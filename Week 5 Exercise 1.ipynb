    "Many probabilistic systems with discrete states can be simulated with random numbers. As an analogy for these systems, let's look at the more familiar 6-sided die.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you roll a single 6-sided die, the result is a uniform distribution of values from 1 to 6. If you roll two dice and sum them, you get values from 2 to 12, with 7 being the most likely, etc. In general, the behavior of any number of dice is well described by the [binormal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "But, what happens if we modify these rules? Suppose that if a die rolls 6, we get to re-roll it and add the second result to the first. If we roll a second 6, we add it and then roll the die again, and so on. For example, we could roll 6+6+6+2 for a total of 20 on a single die. In principle, there is no limit to how high a number we could roll using this scheme (although large values become increasingly unlikely). Let's call this an \"opened-ended die\" If we repeat this procedure with multiple open-ended dice, we should get something resembling a distorted binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that \"rolls\" $N$ open-ended dice and sums the total value rolled, with this process repeated $M$ times, where $N$ and $M$ are both selected using widgets from `ipywidgets`. Let $N$ range from 1 to 20 dice, and let $M$ range from 100 to 10000 trials (in steps of 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the resulting distribution as a bar chart, with the y-axis of your chart showing the **probability** that the sum has a given value. For example, if a value has a probability of 0.2, that means means that there is a 20% chance of rolling that value. Put another way, changing the value of $M$ should not change the vertical scale of your chart. It should only affect the amount of noise."
